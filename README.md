# F.R.I.E.N.D.S. script generator
Welcome to my F.R.I.E.N.D.S. script generator ! This is my first text-generation project using machine learning. 
<br/><br/>It is really easy to use: type a first line in the input and let the magic happen!
<br/>It is a small model, mainly inspired by [Yliess Hati](https://github.com/yliess86)'s code. Due to the low performances of my laptop,  there is a lot of room for improvment and fine-tuning.
## Stack
This project is mainly using:
- Pytorch
- Onnx and Onnxruntime web

## Training transcript
The text for the training dataset is from [this Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanstonebraker/friends-transcript) page.

I hope you'll enjoy it, and have fun !
<br/>
